Our\\nunderstanding of these problems has arguably been slowed by an overreliance on study designs that\\ncompare diagnostic groups and fail to capture the over lap across different neurodevelopmental disorders and\\nthe heterogeneity within them. Methods: We recruited a large transdiagnostic cohort of children with complex\\nneeds ( N=805) to identify distinct subgroups of children with common proﬁles of behavioural and language\\nstrengths and difﬁculties. We then investigated whether and how these data-driven groupings could be\\ndistinguished from a comparison sample ( N=158) on measures of academic and socioemotional functioning and\\npatterns of global and local white matter connectome organisation. Academic skills were assessed viastandardised measures of reading and maths. Socioemotional functioning was captured by the parent-rated\\nversion of the Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire. Results: We identiﬁed three distinct subgroups of\\nchildren, each with different levels of difﬁculties in structural language, pragmatic communication, and hot andcool executive functions. All three subgroups struggled with academic and socioemotional skills relative to the\\ncomparison sample, potentially representing three alternative but related developmental pathways to difﬁculties\\nin these areas. The children with the weakest language skills had the most widespread difﬁculties with learning,whereas those with more pronounced difﬁculties with hot executive skills experienced the most severe difﬁculties\\nin the socioemotional domain. Each data-driven subgroup could be distinguished from the comparison sample\\nbased on both shared and subgroup-unique patterns of neural white matter organisation. Children with the mostpronounced deﬁcits in language, cool executive, or hot executive function were differentiated from the comparison\\nsample by altered connectivity in predominantly thalamocortical, temporal –parietal-occipital, and frontostriatal\\ncircuits, respectively. Conclusions: These ﬁndings advance our understanding of commonly co-morbid\\nbehavioural and language problems and their relationship to behavioural outcomes and neurobiologicalsubstrates. Keywords: Neurodevelopmental disorders; communication; neural development; language;\\nbehaviour problems.\\nIntroduction\\nDifﬁculties with social communication, executive\\nfunctions (EF), and behaviour are common acrossa range of neurodevelopmental conditions. Prag-matic or social communication impairments areincluded in the diagnos tic criteria for autism\\nspectrum disorders (ASD) and social (pragmatic)communication disorders. Difﬁculties with atten-\\ntion and/or behaviour are characteristic of atten-\\ntion deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), andstructural language problems are the hallmark ofdevelopmental language disorder (DLD) (AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2013 ). While typically\\nassociated with separate disorders, these difﬁcul-ties commonly co-occur across diagnoses. Forexample, children with ADHD often have prag-\\nm a t i cl a n g u a g ed i f ﬁ c u l t i e s( G r e e n ,J o h n s o n ,&Bretherton, 2014 ), and structural communication\\np r o b l e m sa r ec o m m o ni nb o t hc h i l d r e nw i t hADHD (Korrel, Mueller, Silk, Anderson, & Sciber-ras, 2017 ) and ASD (Mandy, Wang, Lee, &\\nSkuse, 2017 ). Similarly, behavioural and atten-\\ntional difﬁculties occur in both ASD and DLD(Henry, Messer, & Nash, 2012 ; Rommelse,\\nGeurts, Franke, Buitelaar, & Hartman, 2011 ).\\nThese comorbidities suggest that problems withsocial communication, EF and behaviour mightnot be independent and disorder-speciﬁc.Instead, they likely share common aetiological\\norigins and/or may interact dynamically, such\\nthat difﬁculties in one area might cascade devel-opmentally to trigger problems in another (Mas-ten et al., 2005 ).\\nComorbidity is one of the main challenges to the\\ncurrent diagnostic system. This is further com-pounded by high levels of symptom variabilitywithin diagnostic categories: very different pro-\\nﬁles of strengths and difﬁculties are common\\namong children with the same diagnostic label\\n†The CALM Team members are presented in\\nAcknowledgements\\nConﬂict of interest statement: No conﬂicts declared.\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

For example, not all children with\\nADHD have EF impairments, and there is sub-stantial heterogeneity among those who do (Koﬂeret al., 2019 ). This has led to widespread recogni-\\ntion of the limitations of diagnostic frameworks\\nfor guiding research and support strategies, andan increase in the applicat ion of transdiagnostic\\napproaches for understan ding neurodevelopment\\n(see Astle, Holmes, Kievit, & Gathercole, 2021 ,f o r\\nar e v i e w ) .\\nTransdiagnostic approaches to neurodevelopment\\nThe dominant method for studying neurodevelop-mental disorders involves comparing groups ofchildren with a neurodevelopmental disorder toanother diagnostic/deﬁcit group, or a typicallydeveloping group, using univariate analyticalapproaches to tease apart differences. Transdiag-nostic approaches adopt alternative recruitment\\nand analytical strategies. In these studies, children\\nwith a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders arerecruited, and/or diagnosis-based enrolment isreplaced with enrolment based on needs. In thelatter case, children who experience difﬁculties inthe studied realm(s) are sampled regardless ofwhether their needs meet diagnostic thresholds(Holmes, Bryant, & Gathercole, 2019 ). Alternatively,\\nlarge demographically representative cohorts,\\nincluding individuals spanning the full spectrumof ability, are studied.\\nIn terms of analyses, one goal is to identify\\ndimensional characteristics that can predict orexplain difﬁculties experienced across individualsirrespective of diagnostic status (e.g. Brislinet al., 2021 ). The relations between different\\ndimensions and their links to neural/genetic fac-\\ntors can then be studied to identify potentialmechanisms of shared or unique variance(Holmes et al., 2020 ; Parkes et al., 2021 ). A com-\\nplementary analytical approach often described asclustering orsubtyping ,\\n1focuses on deriving\\nhomogenous data-driven groupings of children withsimilar proﬁles of relative strengths and weak-\\nnesses along the studied dimensions (Feczko\\net al., 2018 ). These novel groupings can then be\\nsimilarly used to facilitate the discovery of commonaetiological pathways to speciﬁc difﬁculties or tostratify individuals to support strategies appropri-ate for their needs.\\nBoth approaches provide important and comple-\\nmentary insights into the aetiology of transdiagnos-\\ntic symptoms and their implications for functioning.\\nAs one example, consider EFs. Dimensionalapproaches provide support for two dimensions ofEF: cool EFs refer to the ability to regulate behaviourand cognition in emotionally neutral contexts,whereas hot EF skills are implicated in situationsof stronger motivational and emotional valence(Castellanos, Sonuga-Barke, Milham, & Tan-\\nnock, 2006 ). Studies using dimensional analyses\\nreveal these dimensions of EF are related, but areassociated with relatively distinct neural networks(Salehinejad, Ghanavati, Rashid, & Nitsche, 2021 )\\nand have somewhat different predictive validity in\\nterms of cool EF being more closely related toacademic achievement and hot EF more predictiveof disruptive behaviours (e.g. Willoughby, Kuper-smidt, Voegler-Lee, & Bryant, 2011 ).\\nSubgrouping approaches similarly reveal that dif-\\nferent EF proﬁles have relatively distinct neuralcorrelates and are associated with different out-\\ncomes. For example, Vaidya et al. ( 2020 ) identiﬁed\\nthree data-driven EF-subgroups across typicallydeveloping, autistic and ADHD children. These sub-groups explained more variance in frontal –parietal\\nengagement (inferred via functional MRI) during asustained attention task than diagnostic groupings.Similarly, Bathelt, Holmes, et al. ( 2018 ) identiﬁed\\nthree distinct EF-subgroups in a transdiagnostic\\nsample of struggling youth. Each subgroup was\\nassociated with different variations in white matterconnections in prefrontal regions, and there wasmore within-group homogeneity in the behaviouralproﬁles of the derived subgroups than in groupingsbased on the diagnosis. Both examples demonstratethat studying subgroups in transdiagnostic samplescan facilitate the linking of behavioural phenotypes\\nto neurophysiological mechanisms.\\nTransdiagnostic approaches to neurodevelopmental\\ncomorbidities\\nThe examples of transdiagnostic designs described so\\nfar are typical of the ﬁeld, with a focus on onedomain\\nof function (e.g., EF). An important next step is to\\napply these methods to multiple areas of functioning\\nto advance our understanding of the co-occurrence ofdifﬁculties across multiple domains. We attempted to\\ndo this in an earlier study by exploring how symptomsof communication, behaviour, and EF difﬁcultiesrelate to one another in a transdiagnostic cohort ofchildren (Mareva & Holmes, 2019 ). Using a network\\napproach, we were able to investigate how speciﬁc\\nsymptoms cluster together and start to understand\\nhow these clusters of difﬁculties are linked.\\nFour densely interrelated clusters of symptoms\\nwere identiﬁed relating to structural language andlearning, hot EF, pragmatic communication and peerrelationships, and cool EF. The symptoms withineach cluster did not align with the diagnosticfeatures of any diagnosis. Moreover, speciﬁc symp-\\ntoms bridged these clusters (e.g., inappropriate\\ninitiation of communication linked the pragmaticcommunication and hot EF clusters), providing someinsight into the co-occurrence of symptoms acrossdomains of difﬁculty. It may be the case that thesebridging symptoms trigger difﬁculties through devel-opmental cascades (Masten et al., 2005 ) or,\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

It isalso possible that bridging symptoms do not signalinteracting areas of difﬁculties, but instead reﬂectshared neural and/or genetic underpinnings.\\nLinking transdiagnostic proﬁles to aetiological\\nfactors\\nClassifying individuals into heterogeneous and often\\noverlapping diagnostic categories makes it difﬁcultto understand the shared inﬂuence of aetiologicalfactors (Kapur, Phillips, & Insel, 2012 ), but identify-\\ning groups of children with similar behavioural\\nproﬁles, irrespective of diagnostic status, may pro-vide one way to map symptoms on to underlyingneurophysiology (e.g., Bathelt, Holmes, et al., 2018 ;\\nVaidya et al., 2020 ). In the current study, we use this\\napproach to identify groups of children with similarproﬁles across multiple domains of function andexplore group differences in neural white matter\\norganisation. Diffusion tensor imaging enabled us to\\nestimate the macroscopic organisation of the white-matter connectivity of the brain in vivo. By analysingwhat are known as structural connectomes (Basser,Pajevic, Pierpaoli, Duda, & Aldroubi, 2000 ) we were\\nable to explore how brain connectivity varied acrosschildren in the different subgroups. We focused onwhite matter because its maturation is an important\\naspect of post-natal neural development. White\\nmatter architecture enables efﬁcient communicationbetween discrete brain regions and shapes theprocesses underlying brain function (Honey, Thi-vierge, & Sporns, 2010 ). Variation in global white\\nmatter organisation has been linked to differences ingeneral cognitive abilities, reading and mathematicsskills (Bathelt, Gathercole, Butterﬁeld, &\\nAstle, 2018 ; Bathelt, Scerif, Nobre, & Astle, 2019 ;\\nKoenis et al., 2015 ). It has also been implicated in\\nneurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD andASD (Beare et al., 2017 ; Cao et al., 2013 ; Qian\\net al., 2021 ), with both shared and distinct differ-\\nences reported in white matter organisation acrosschildren with different neurodevelopmental disor-ders (Ameis et al., 2016 ; Qian et al., 2021 ). Exam-\\nples of structural neural substrate variation\\nimplicated in multiple neurodevelopmental condi-tions include the corticostriatal circuits, thalamicradiations, and interhemispheric pathways (Ameiset al., 2016 ; Aoki et al., 2017 ; Arnsten &\\nRubia, 2012 ; Tung et al., 2021 ; Zhao, Yang, Gong,\\nCao, & Liu, 2022 ).\\nThe current study\\nThe aim of the current study was to identify\\nhomogenous subgroups of children with similarbehavioural, EF, and communication strengths/dif-ﬁculties in a large transdiagnostic sample. We thenexplored how the proﬁles of these transdiagnosticsubgroups related to measures of white matter\\norganisation, and academic and socioemotional\\nfunctioning. Our previous study included a subsam-ple of the currently studied population, andfocussed on identifying clusters of symptoms that\\ncharacterised the sample (Mareva & Holmes, 2019 ).\\nIndividual differences at the symptom level can driveclusters or subgroups of individuals who share\\nsimilar symptom proﬁles. Therefore, here, we use a\\ncomplementary subgrouping approach to study how\\nthis space is occupied by participants , enabling us to\\nfurther explore the associations between these pro-ﬁles and academic and socioemotional functioningand underlying neurobiology. In other words, wesearched for individuals with similar proﬁles acrossthe four previously identiﬁed clusters of difﬁculties.The measures included in the subgrouping were\\nchosen to capture transdiagnostic features (i.e.,\\nthose that have been previously implicated in severaldisorders). These were measured by parent ratingson scales commonly used across health and educa-tional settings. To explore the external validity of thesubgroups and further characterise their proﬁles, weinvestigated how they differed on external (i.e., notincluded in the subgroup identiﬁcation) measures of\\nnonverbal cognitive ability, and academic and\\nsocioemotional functioning, which are theorised tobe related to interindividual differences in commu-nication and EF (Arnold, Hodgkins, Kahle, Madhoo,& Kewley, 2020 ; Harpin, Mazzone, Raynaud, Kahle,\\n& Hodgkins, 2016 ; Helland & Helland, 2017 ). We\\ndid not formulate a hypothesis about the number ofgroups, their speciﬁc proﬁles, or the neural and\\nexternal behavioural features that would differenti-\\nate them. Instead, we designed the study as anexploratory investigation aiming to address twobroad questions: (a) can we identify robust sub-groups of children presenting with distinct proﬁles ofexecutive, language, and communication strengths/difﬁculties within a large transdiagnostic sample ofstruggling learners; (b) do such data-driven groups\\nshow any differences in academic attainment,\\nsocioemotional functioning, and white matter organ-isation relative to a comparison sample.\\nMethods\\nThe data presented here were collected as part of a cohort\\nstudy at the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory(CALM). Data collection took part between 2014 and 2021.\\nRecruitment\\nFull details about the CALM cohort are available in the studyprotocol (Holmes et al., 2019 ). Brieﬂy, two groups of children\\nwere recruited: (a) a cohort of children aged 5 –18 years who\\nwere referred by health and education practitioners for difﬁ-culties with attention, memory, and/or learning; (b) a com-parison group who were not referred for difﬁculties.

Children in both groups wereenrolled into the study irrespective of diagnostic status or\\nperformance cut-offs, providing they met the following inclu-\\nsion criteria: (a) native English speaker, (b) no uncorrectedsensory impairments, and (c) no conﬁrmed presence of genetic\\nor neurological conditions known to affect cognitive ability.\\nParticipants\\nThe referred cohort included 805 children (69% male,\\nMage=9.48, SDage=2.38) and the comparison 158 children\\n(56% male, Mage=10,SDage=2.33). The majority (63%) of the\\nreferred cohort were referred by education practitioners (e.g.,educational psychologist, special educational needs coordina-tor); 33% were referred by health professionals (e.g., clinical\\npsychologist, child psychiatrist); and 4% by speech and\\nlanguage therapists. Diagnoses were reported by the referrerand conﬁrmed by parents. Most of the sample (60%) wereundiagnosed, despite being recognised by a professional as\\nhaving additional needs, and 8% had more than one diagnosis.\\nAmong those with diagnoses ADHD was the most common(N=197), followed by ASD ( N=57), and diagnoses of learning\\ndisorders (e.g., dyslexia, dyscalculia, DLD, N=62). The non-\\nreferred sample consisted mostly of children without anydiagnoses (96%), and among those with diagnoses one hadADHD, two had DLD, and two had dyslexia. For the comparison\\nsample, diagnostic status was reported by parents/carers.\\nAssessments\\nEach child completed a battery of neuropsychological assess-\\nments following the procedures documented in the assess-\\nment’s testing kits (see Holmes et al., 2019 for details).\\nParents/caregivers provided ratings of their child’s behaviour,communication, and socioemotional functioning. All childrenwere invited to participate in an optional neuroimaging session\\nwithin six months of their behavioural assessment (referred\\nsample: N=313, age at scan: M=10.23, SD=2.32; compar-\\nison sample: N=77, age at scan: M=10.75, SD=2.01). The\\nassessments included in the current study are described\\nbelow.\\nCommunity detection. Conners-3: The Conners Par-\\nent Rating Short Form 3rd Edition (Conners, 2008 ) asks about\\nthe child’s ADHD-related difﬁculties in the past month. Item\\nratings are summarised into six subscales: Inattention, Hyper-\\nactivity/Impulsivity, Learning problems, Executive function,Aggression, and Peer relations. Raw scores were calculated,but age was regressed from each subscale to ensure the\\nanalyses were not biased by age.\\nBrief rating inventory of executive function\\n(BRIEF): The BRIEF (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & Kenwor-\\nthy, 2000 ) captures behaviours related to EF. The 80 items\\nin the checklist cover eight domains: Inhibition, Shifting,\\nEmotional control, Initiation, Working memory, Planning,Organisation, and Monitoring. Raw scores were calculated,\\nbut age was regressed from each subscale to ensure the\\nanalyses were not biased by age.\\nChildren’s communication checklist (CCC-2): The\\nCCC-2 (Bishop, 2003 ) focuses on communication strengths\\nand weaknesses. Items are organised into 10 subscales:\\nSpeech, Syntax, Semantics, Coherence, Inappropriate initia-\\ntion, Stereotyped language, Use of context, Nonverbal commu-nication, Social relations, and Interests. Raw scores werecalculated, but age was regressed from each subscale to\\nensure the analyses were not biased by age.\\nSubgroup validation. Strengths and difﬁculties\\nquestionnaire (SDQ): The SDQ (Goodman, 1997 ) mea-\\nsures social and emotional functioning. Items are organised\\ninto ﬁve subscales (only four were analysed in the currentstudy): Emotional Problems, Conduct Problems, Peer Problems,and Prosocial. The ﬁnal SDQ subscale was omitted because it\\ncaptures hyperactivity and overlaps with the Hyperactivity/\\nImpulsivity subscale of the Conners-3 that was included in thecommunity detection. Age-uncorrected SDQ scores were usedin all analyses to allow for easier comparisons with other studies\\nusing this measure. Analyses using age-regressed scores sup-\\nported the same conclusions (Appendix S2).\\nReading and mathematics: To assess children’s aca-\\ndemic abilities the Word Reading and Numerical Operationssubtests of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-II(Wechsler, 2005 ) were administered. Raw scores for each\\nsubtest were converted to age-referenced standard scores to\\nenable performance to be compared to age-expected norms.\\nNonverbal cognitive ability: The Matrix Reasoning\\nsubtest of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence\\n(Wechsler, 2011 ) was administered as an index of non-verbal\\ncognitive ability. The raw score, corresponding to the numberof correctly completed matrices, was converted into an age-referenced T-score, allowing for straightforward interpretation\\nrelative to age-expected levels.\\nMRI data acquisition\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected on aSiemens 3T Prisma-ﬁt system using a 32-channel quadrature\\nhead coil. T1-weighted volume scans were acquired using awhole-brain coverage 3D Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acqui-sition Gradient Echo (MP RAGE) sequence acquired using\\n1 mm isometric image resolution. Echo time was 2.98 ms, and\\nrepetition time was 2,250 ms. Diffusion scans were obtainedusing echo-planar diffusion-weighted images with an isotropicset of 68 noncollinear directions, using a weighting factor of\\nb=1,000 s 9mm\\n/C02, interleaved with 4 T2-weighted ( b=0)\\nvolume. Whole brain coverage was based on 60 contiguousaxial slices and isometric image resolution of 2 mm. Echo time\\nwas 90 ms and repetition time was 8,500 ms. Both MRI pre-\\nprocessing and reconstruction were performed using QSIPrep0.13.0RC1, which is based on Nipype 1.6.0 (Gorgolewskiet al., 2011 ). All pre-processing steps are reported in the\\nSupporting Information (Appendix S3). Whole-brain white\\nmatter connectivity matrices (i.e. connectomes) were con-structed for each child based on the Brainnetome atlas (Fanet al., 2016 ). For each pairwise combination of regions\\n(N=246), the number of streamlines intersecting them was\\nestimated and transformed to a 246 9246 streamline matrix.\\nStatistical analysis overview\\nA data-driven community detection algorithm was applied to\\nthe child-by-child associations across the behaviour, EF, andcommunication ratings in the referred sample to identifysubgroups of children with similar proﬁles of behavioural\\nand communication strengths and difﬁculties. The demo-\\ngraphic and diagnostic characteristics, academic performance,socioemotional ratings, and neural white matter connectionswere then compared across the derived subgroups and the\\ncomparison sample.

A network was built to represent\\nthechild-by-childcorrelationsacrossthe24subscalesoftheCCC-2, Conners-3, and BRIEF questionnaires for those in the referred\\nsample. Child-by-child correlations were the focus of the commu-\\nnity detection to capture similarities and differences in children’sproﬁles across the subscales. This method has been previouslyused to identify subgroups of children with similar neuropsycho-\\nlogical proﬁles, temperaments, and EF-related behavioural prob-\\nlems (Bathelt, Holmes, et al., 2018 ; Fair, Bathula, Nikolas, &\\nNigg, 2012 ; Karalunas et al., 2014 ). Before estimating the child-\\nby-child correlations, missing data were estimated and age was\\nregressed from each scale to ensure the community detection was\\nnot biased by age (see Appendix S1for details). The community\\ndetection was based on the Louvain weight-conserving algorithm\\n(gamma set at default value of 1), as implemented in the Brain\\nConnectivity Toolbox (BCT: Rubinov & Sporns, 2010 ). The\\nstrength of the community separation was quantiﬁed using theasymmetric modularity (Q) index (Rubinov & Sporns, 2011 ),\\nwhich conceptually represents the overall segregation between\\nidentiﬁed communities, with values above 0.3 considered evi-dence for sufﬁcient community separation (Blondel, Guillaume,Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008 ; Newman & Girvan, 2004 ). This\\nmethod performs well in recovering the true number of commu-\\nnities across a range of conditions and simulations suggest thesample size of the referred cohort was suitable for this analysis(Agelink van Rentergem, Bathelt, & Geurts, 2021 ;G a t e s ,H e n r y ,\\nSteinley, & Fair, 2016 ). To reach a stable community assignment,\\nwe applied the consensus clustering method with 1,000 iterations(Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2012 ), a procedure that has demon-\\nstrated robustness even at substantial levels of noise in the data\\n(Bathelt, Holmes, et al., 2018 ).\\nSubgroup proﬁles and behavioural validation. A\\nseries of two-tailed t-tests with Holm corrected p-values were\\nrun to compare the proﬁles of the derived subgroups to each\\nother, and to the comparison group, to quantify variation in the\\nseverity of difﬁculties across data-driven groups and to capturedifferences relative to the non-referred children. To facilitatethe interpretation of the subgroup proﬁles, the communication\\nand behavioural data used in the community detection were\\nreduced via Principal Component analyses (PCA) and compo-nent scores were extracted and compared across the groups.\\nData from both the referred and comparison samples were\\ncombined for the PCA, and the optimal number of componentsto retain was chosen based on the results of parallel analyses(see Appendix S2). Separate PCAs were run for the measure of\\ncommunication (CCC-2) and the two measures of behaviour\\ncombined (BRIEF and Conners-3). Additional group compar-isons were conducted on measures not included in thecommunity detection to externally validate and further char-\\nacterise the proﬁles of the subgroups.\\nNeuroimaging analysis. Neural white matter connec-\\ntome data were analysed using graph theory. The nodes of the\\nnetwork were the 246 regions of the Brainnetome atlas (Fan\\net al., 2016 ) and the connections (or edges) corresponded to the\\nnumber of streamlines intersecting each pair of regions. Allconnectome analyses are based on weighted unthresholded\\nmatrices. This choice was motivated by observing that the\\napplication of consistency-thresholding (Roberts, Perry, Roberts,Mitchell, & Breakspear, 2017 ) to retain the top 30% or 20% of\\nmost consistent edges (on the assumption that the connections\\nwith the highest inter-subject variability are spurious) fully\\nreproduced the results based on unthresholded matrices. Weexplored whether and how each derived subgroup differed from\\nthe comparison sample and did not compare the data-driven\\nsubgroups to one another. This approach was chosen to reducethe number of comparisons and to investigate both common andsubgroup-uniquedifferencesamongthereferredchildrenrelative\\nto the non-referred children. Due to the presence of outliers in thedata, the global and local metrics of the data-driven subgroups\\nwere compared to the comparison group using 10% trimmed-\\nmeans pairwise t-tests with false-discovery rate correction.\\nGlobal and local metrics: At the whole-brain level, we\\nfocussed on global efﬁciency and global clustering coefﬁcients.\\nThese metrics were chosen because they have been previously\\nlinked to children’s educational attainment and general cognitiveabilities (Bathelt, Gathercole, et al., 2018 ,B a t h e l te ta l . , 2019 ;\\nKoenis et al., 2015 ) and have been implicated in neurodevelop-\\nmental disorders such as ADHD (Cao et al., 2013 ). Global\\nefﬁciency describes the potential for information exchange inthenetworkandistheaverageinversedistancefromanynode(i.e.brain region) to any other node (Sporns, Honey, & K €otter, 2007 ).\\nGlobal clustering quantiﬁes the fraction of each node’s neigh-\\nboursthatarealsoneighboursofeachother.Theglobalclusteringmetric was normalised according to the average of 1,000 randomgraphs using the algorithms for weighted undirected networks\\nimplemented in the GRETNA toolbox (Wang et al., 2015 ). Subse-\\nquently, to explore the local properties of the connectomes withthe minimal number of comparisons, the 246 brain regions in the\\nBrainnetome atlas (Fan et al., 2016 ) were grouped according to\\ntheir corresponding intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN) asdeﬁned by Yeo et al. ( 2011 ): Default mode, Dorsal attention,\\nFrontoparietal, Limbic, Somatomotor, and Visual networks.\\nSubcortical regions were also grouped together. The sum of all\\nconnections within each network (and the subcortex) of theconnectomewascalculated.Thisapproachisbasedontheknownstructuralandfunctionalorganisationpropertiesofthe brainand\\nwas therefore favoured as a balanced alternative to hypothesis-\\ndriven pre-speciﬁed regions of interest approach or a fully data-driven reduction of the connectomes. For each data-driven\\nsubgroup, networks that showed a signiﬁcant difference from\\nthe comparison group were selected for further analyses. Subse-quently,thenodestrength(i.e.,thesumofallconnections)ineachregion within the networks ﬂagged as signiﬁcantly different was\\ntested against the comparison group. The functional character-\\nisation of these regions was based on the behavioural domainmetadata labels of the BrainMap Database ( www.brainmap.org/\\ntaxonomy ), which uses both forward and reverse inferences\\n(Eickhoff & Grefkes, 2011 ; Fox, Lancaster, Laird, & Eick-\\nhoff, 2014 ). Prior to the analyses, age, sex, and average frame\\ndisplacement were regressed from each graph metric using a\\nrobustregressionapproachtoaccountforoutliers.Controllingfor\\nthese covariates is recommended and is standard practice inneurodevelopmental neuroimaging research (Alexander-Blochet al., 2016 ;J o n e se ta l . , 2021 ;L u n ae ta l . , 2021 ).\\nNetwork-based statistics (NBS): To investigate differ-\\nences in the connections between regions we used NBS, which in\\nmany cases offers greater statistical power compared to tradi-tional correction methods (Zalesky, Fornito, & Bullmore, 2010 ).\\nThis is a whole-brain data-driven method and is described in\\ndetail in Appendix S3. Brieﬂy, each data-driven subgroup was\\ncompared to the non-referred group to identify subnetworksthat differentiate the groups. The following parameters were\\nused: t-threshold 2.8, intensity measure of size, and family-wise\\nerror (FWE) p<.01. Age, sex, and average frame displacement\\nwere used as covariates in all analyses. To ensure the robust-ness of the results, we repeated all procedures by varying the\\ntarget t-threshold, exploring the extent-based measure of size,\\nand setting a more liberal FWE-correction ( p<.05).\\nRESULTS\\nCommunity detection\\nCommunity detection applied to the child-by-child\\ncorrelation network based on the Louvain algorithm\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

The value of the Q-metric was above 0.3,\\nsuggesting a good level of community separation(Blondel et al., 2008 ).\\nSubgroup proﬁles\\nThe proﬁles of the subgroups identiﬁed by the\\ncommunity detection and the comparison groupacross the 24 subscales are displayed in Figure 1A.\\nDescriptive statistics and Cohen’s deffect size are\\npresented in Table S1. To aid the interpretation of\\nthe differences across the groups, data were reduced\\nwith two PCAs, one applied to the CCC-2 and a\\nsecond to the combined BRIEF and Conners-3 data(see Figures S2and S3for correlations). This deci-\\nsion allowed us to consider communication andbehaviour separately. The CCC-2 data reductionidentiﬁed two components capturing structural andpragmatic communication, which in combinationexplained 80% of the variance. Two components\\nbroadly corresponding to hot EF and cool EF sum-\\nmarised the Conners-3 and BRIEF data, cumula-tively explaining 68% of the variance (Figure 1B,C ;\\nfull report in the Appendix S2and Figures S4and\\nS5). As a sensitivity analysis, in Appendix S2we also\\nreport the results of parallel analysis and PCAapplied to the CCC-2, Conners-3, and BRIEF datatogether. This approach supported broadly similar\\nconclusions, with the exception that hot EF and\\npragmatic skills loaded on a single component. Thefull details are available in the Supporting Informa-tion (Figures S6andS7).\\nGroup proﬁles across the four components are\\ndisplayed in Figure 1D. The data-driven subgroups\\nhad signiﬁcantly more difﬁculties across all compo-nents relative to the comparison sample, except for\\nSubgroup 2 (S2) who had similar hot EF to the\\ncomparison sample. The children in each subgrouphad different patterns of speciﬁc strengths anddifﬁculties. Subgroup 1 (S1) were characterised bypoor structural language, children in S2 had weak-nesses in cool EF, and children in Subgroup 3 (S3)had pronounced difﬁculties with hot EF and prag-matics (Table S2). The same patterns were evident in\\nthe subgroup proﬁles on the subscales that most\\nstrongly loaded on the respective principal compo-nents (Table S1and Figure 1A). One-way ANOVA\\nsuggested no signiﬁcant differences in age across thesubgroups ( F(1,803) =3.138, p=.08, Table 1), but\\npairwise t-tests with Holm correction for multiple\\ncomparisons suggested that children in S2 weresigniﬁcantly older than children in S3 ( t=2.56,\\np\\ncorrected =.03), with an average difference of\\n6.34 months. Using a chi-square test, which com-pared the overall proportion of boys and girls in thenon-referred sample to the proportion observed ineach subgroup, we observed that girls were overrep-resented in S1, while boys were overrepresented in S3(Table 1). The same chi-square analyses were used toinvestigate whether there were differences in the\\nprevalence of different diagnoses across subgroups.We focused on children with ADHD and ASDbecause overall numbers for other diagnoses weretoo low to make meaningful comparisons. Children\\nwith ADHD and ASD were represented in each\\nsubgroup, but children with ADHD were overrepre-sented in S3 and underrepresented in S1, andchildren with ASD were underrepresented in S2 andoverrepresented in S3 (Table 1). Analyses compar-\\ning the prevalence of ADHD subtypes across clus-ters were not pursued due to most children withADHD having a diagnosis of Combined type ADHD.\\nOnly one child had a diagnosis of predominantly\\nHyperactive/ Impulsive ADHD (included in S3) andonly 14 a diagnosis of the predominantly Inattentivetype (two cases included in S1, seven in S2, and ﬁvein S3). Finally, children who had recently receivedSpeech and Language Therapy were overrepre-sented in S1 and underrepresented in the othertwo subgroups (Table 1).\\nSubgroup proﬁles: Behavioural validation\\nThe groups were compared on external measures not\\nused in the community detection (Figure 2). In terms\\nof socioemotional functioning and cognitive andacademic performance, all three subgroups derivedfrom the referred sample had signiﬁcantly more\\ndifﬁculties than the comparison sample (Figure 2).\\nThere were differences in the patterns of severityamong the subgroups. Children in S1 had the mostpronounced difﬁculties with maths, reading, andnon-verbal reasoning, scoring signiﬁcantly lowerthan the other two data-driven groups. Children inS3 had better performance than the other twosubgroups in math and reading, but signiﬁcantly\\nmore difﬁculties with emotion, conduct, peer rela-\\ntions, and prosocial behaviour (Figure 2).\\nOverall, three subgroups were identiﬁed captur-\\ning children with principal difﬁculties with struc-tural communication (S1), cool EFs (S2), and hotEFs and pragmatics (S3).

This subnetwork involved six\\nregions located within the BG, orbital gyrus, andthalamus (Table S5). For S2, there was reduced\\nconnectivity relative to the comparison group in asubnetwork spanning nine connections across 10regions ( p\\ncorrected =.003). This subnetwork included\\nconnections across the following networks: somato-\\nmotor—dorsal attention, limbic —dorsal attention,\\ndorsal attention —visual, frontoparietal —somato-\\nmotor, visual —visual, and dorsal attention —\\nsubcortical. The involved regions fell within thelateral occipital cortex (LOC), medioventral occipitalcortex, orbital gyrus, PHG, precuneus, superiorparietal lobule, STG, and thalamus (Table S6).\\nFinally, S3 had reduced connection strength relative\\nto the comparison group in a subnetwork comprised\\nof eight links ( p\\ncorrected =.002) across limbic —\\nsubcortical, limbic —visual, visual —subcortical,\\nand subcortical —subcortical regions.

Sensitivity\\nanalyses supported the robustness of the ﬁndings:taking the extent-based measure of size fully repro-duced the results; and setting the t-threshold in the\\nrange of 2.6 to 3, produced similar results, whichfollowed the expected tendency to discover largersubnetworks at lower t-thresholds (Figure S11; for\\nan investigation of the inﬂuence of the t-threshold,\\nsee Beare et al., 2017 ).\\nOverall, the three subgroups showed a mix of\\nsimilar and subgroup-unique patterns of differenti-ation from the comparison sample. At the globallevel, the two groups (S1 and S2) with the mostpronounced difﬁculties with academic achievementshowed reduced global efﬁciency compared to the\\nnon-referred group. At the ICN-level, all subgroups\\nshowed reduced connection strengths in the limbicnetwork and the subcortex relative to the compar-ison sample. There were both common andsubgroup-speciﬁc differences in the connectionstrength of regions within the limbic network andthe subcortex. Finally, at a whole-connectome level,we identiﬁed subnetworks that differentiated each\\nsubgroup from the comparison sample.\\nDiscussion\\nThe current study adopted a data-driven approach toidentify subgroups of children with homogeneousproﬁles across different domains of function asmeasured by ratings of communication, behaviour,and EF. A transdiagnostic approach was used:enrolment was based on cognitive and academicneeds rather than diagnostic status. Differences inbrain structure and behaviour were compared\\nacross the subgroups in relation to a comparison\\ngroup. Three subgroups of children were identiﬁed.Each performed more poorly than the comparisongroup across measures of communication, beha-viour, and EF, and was distinguished from the othersubgroups by different proﬁles of strengths andweaknesses in these areas. These differencesextended to measures of cognitive, academic, and\\nsocioemotional functioning that were not included in\\nthe identiﬁcation of the subgroups. Shared andspeciﬁc patterns of differences in neural white mat-ter organisation were observed across the groups.These results are discussed below.\\nSubgroups\\nThree data-driven subgroups were identiﬁedbased on parent/carer ratings of behaviour, com-munication, and EF in a large transdiagnostic sam-ple of children referred by practitioners fordifﬁculties in attention, learning, and/or memory.One subgroup (S1) was characterised by relativedifﬁculties in structural language use, a second bycool cognitive difﬁculties (S2), and a third by co-\\noccurring pragmatic communication difﬁculties and\\nhotaffective cognitive problems (S3). All three sub-\\ngroups had greater difﬁculties in behaviour, com-munication, EF, socioemotional functioning, andacademic attainment relative to a demographicallymatched comparison group of non-referred children.\\nThere were both similarities and differences in the\\nway neural white matter was organised in the three\\nsubgroups relative to the comparison group.

These difﬁculties encompassed everyday dif-ﬁculties in attention, planning, and working memory -skills that have been implicated in classroom learning(Peng, Wang, & Namkung, 2018 ). Consistent with\\nthis, children in this subgroup had difﬁculties inmaths and reading, although these were not as severe\\nas those for children in S1. Relative to the other two\\nsubgroups, children in S2 had relative strengths insocial skills and affective cognition, with comparablehot EF ratings to the comparison group.\\nSubregions that uniquely deviated in S2 included\\nregions within the caudate, PHG, ITG, STG, andlateral amygdala. The subnetwork that differentiatedthem from the comparison group was relatively\\nwidespread and involved right-lateralised temporal –\\nparietal pathways and medioventral and lateraloccipital regions. Some of the implicated subregionsof these dorsal attention and visual networks areknown to interact to suppress attention to irrelevantstimuli (Castellanos & Proal, 2012 ; Shulman\\net al., 2009 ), and as such reduced connectivity in\\nthis neural circuit might contribute to the cool EF-\\nrelated difﬁculties characteristic of this subgroup. In\\nparticular, seven of the nine connections within theidentiﬁed subnetwork involved right caudal area 7,which is implicated in cool EFs such as attention,working memory, inhibition, and spatial cognition(for details, see http://atlas.brainnetome.org/ , Fan\\net al., 2016 ).\\nS3\\nThe children in S3 were characterised by having the\\nmost severe difﬁculties with hot EF and pragmaticcommunication, but relative strengths in structurallanguage skills, maths and reading, compared to thechildren in the other two subgroups. Strong associ-ations between social communication skills and\\naffective behavioural problems have been reported\\npreviously (e.g., Hawkins, Gathercole, Astle, &Holmes, 2016 ; Mareva & Holmes, 2019 ), and difﬁ-\\nculties in these areas commonly co-occur in ADHDand ASD (Green et al., 2014 ) alongside socioemo-\\ntional difﬁculties (Staikova, Gomes, Tartter, McCabe,& Halperin, 2013 ). Indeed, a disproportionate num-\\nber of autistic children and children with an ADHD\\ndiagnosis were assigned to this subgroup, and they\\nhad substantial problems with behavioural conduct,emotion, peer relationships, and prosocial beha-viour. Identifying a subgroup with this proﬁle andcomposition suggests the intersection of pragmaticcommunication, hot EF, and socioemotional difﬁcul-ties may be relevant for understanding some of thecomorbidity between ADHD and ASD.The neural characteristics that speciﬁcally differ-\\nentiated children in S3 from the comparison groupwere regions within the putamen, thamalus, andcingulate gyrus. They had reduced connectivitystrength in a left-lateralised, primarily frontostriatal\\nsubnetwork, which also included regions of the\\nvisual network (precuneus and LOC). Consistentwith the severity of their hot EF difﬁculties, thesecircuits play a role in goal-directed behavioursrelated to reward, affect, and motivation (Arnsten &Rubia, 2012 ).\\nSummary of proﬁles\\nIn summary, we identiﬁed three subgroups of\\nchildren with distinct communication, behavioural,and EF proﬁles. These subgroups were charac-terised by primary difﬁculties in structural lan-guage, cool EF, or hot EF and pragmatics,respectively, and provide initial evidence for threealternative but related pathways to academic and\\nsocioemotional difﬁculties. While a greater number\\nof children receiving speech and language therapywere assigned to the structural language subgroup,and more autistic children and those with ADHD tothe hot EF and pragmatics subgroup, none of thesubgroup proﬁles aligned with the diagnostic fea-tures of a particular disorder, and children witheach of these diagnoses were present in each of the\\nthree subgroups. This ﬁnding suggests the sub-\\ngroups were not synonymous with disorder-basedcategories, adding to growing support for transdi-agnostic approaches to understanding neurodevel-opment (Astle et al., 2021 ).\\nThe three subgroups were further distinguished by\\npatterns of differences in the connectivity of circuitspreviously implicated in language, executive and\\nvisual attention, and reward processing. These differ-\\nences partially correspond to previously reportedneurobiological correlates of the behavioural difﬁcul-ties of the subgroups, suggesting they may be distin-guished at the neural level. That said, not all regionsthat uniquely differentiated the subgroups from thenon-referred sample had clear links to their beha-vioural proﬁles. It should also be noted that all\\nsubgroups had reduced connection strength within\\nthe limbic network and the subcortex, relative to thecomparison group, and shared several atypicalitieswithin the same subcortical and temporal subregions.Furthermore, their proﬁles of behavioural weak-nesses were all relative, meaning the correspondencebetween brain and behaviour was not one-to-one.\\nTheoretical and practical implications\\nFollowing decades of research shaped by diagnosticcategories, the ﬁeld of neurodevelopmental difﬁcul-ties is currently undergoing a transition in whichexploratory research into how children and their\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

Such research is key for testing, and\\nwhere necessary accordingly modifying, predomi-nant assumptions about diagnostic boundaries orcommon factors that explain the associations\\nbetween symptoms (Astle & Fletcher-\\nWatson, 2020 ). While the current study was not\\ndesigned to explicitly test or falsify a given theory,the ﬁnding that children with different diagnoseswere represented in all data-driven clusters chal-lenges “core deﬁcit” theories that assume that asingle mechanistic impairment can explain the pro-ﬁle of a particular diagnostic group. Instead, our\\nresults are more consistent with accounts empha-\\nsising the possibility that multiple causal pathwayscan lead to the same behavioural phenotype (Cic-chetti & Rogosch, 1996 ). Relatedly, we found little\\nevidence for neat or direct mappings between iso-lated neural structures and behavioural phenotypes.Most brain atypicalities associated with a givenbehavioural phenotype were also observed across\\nthe other phenotypes, casting doubt on claims that\\nfocal neural deﬁcits underlie a given neurodevelop-mental disorder. Our ﬁndings are instead consistentwith the predictions of neuro-constructivist theoriesthat assume developmental difﬁculties have wide-spread effects that result from a brain that hasdeveloped differently over a number of years (John-son, 2011 ; Karmiloff-Smith, 2009 ).\\nThe categorisation of neurodevelopmental difﬁcul-\\nties into discrete disorders has practical merits inproviding health and education practitioners with apragmatic system for selecting and allocating sup-port. It also provides many young people with asense of identity. Receiving a diagnosis can prove apivotal moment in someone’s life, enabling them toidentify with their community. Yet our data, and that\\nof others, highlight that current diagnostic\\napproaches do not capture what it is like to haveadditional needs: the clusters of behavioural symp-toms that children experience do not map on thediagnostic criteria currently used to identify andsupport children’s needs. As such, a more ﬂexible,child-centred approach is needed in which interven-tion decisions are based on individual needs and not\\nprimary diagnoses (Finlay-Jones et al., 2019 ).\\nAttempts to integrate the neurodevelopmental trans-diagnostic framework into clinical settings are justemerging, and in due course we will start to gaininsights into their efﬁcacy and feasibility (Boultonet al., 2021 ). For now, we advocate transdiagnostic\\napproaches, which align with the neurodiversityparadigm (Fletcher-Watson, 2022 ), as a means of\\npromoting more inclusive research and practice.\\nLimitations and future directions\\nThere were several caveats to the current subgroup-\\ning approach. First, the community detection wasbased on parent ratings, which are prone tosubjective bias. However, the differences between\\nthe subgroups identiﬁed through these ratings werereﬂected in differences in performance-based mea-sures of cognition and learning, providing somevalidity to the ratings and suggesting the algorithm\\nwas not overﬁtting the data. Second, the wide age\\nrange and cross-sectional nature of the cohort didnot allow us to explore questions about age-relatedheterogeneity or developmental continuity. Nonethe-less, we did observe a signiﬁcant age differencebetween S2 and S3, suggesting the S3 phenotypewhich was associated with greater social and emo-tional problems may be more prevalent in younger\\nchildren. Finally, despite the sample being substan-\\ntially larger than that typically used in the develop-mental neuroimaging literature, sample sizeconsiderations did not allow us to directly comparethe neural proﬁles of the identiﬁed subgroups to oneanother. Equally important differences in whitematter organisation across subgroups might exist,but larger datasets would be needed to identify\\nthem.\\nConclusions\\nThis study demonstrates the value of data-driven\\nsubgrouping approaches for understanding com-mon, complex and co-occurring neurodevelopmentaldifﬁculties across multiple domains and their rela-\\ntionships to behavioural outcomes and neurobiol-\\nogy. It shows that homogeneous groups can beidentiﬁed and differentiated in terms of distinctproﬁles of relative strengths and difﬁculties acrosscommunication, executive function, and behaviour.The identiﬁed subgroups provide initial evidence forthree alternative but related developmental path-ways to difﬁculties with academic and socioemo-\\ntional functioning.\\nSupporting information\\nAdditional supporting information may be found online\\nin the Supporting Information section at the end of the\\narticle:\\nAppendix S1.

Our\\nunderstanding of these problems has arguably been slowed by an overreliance on study designs that\\ncompare diagnostic groups and fail to capture the over lap across different neurodevelopmental disorders and\\nthe heterogeneity within them. Methods: We recruited a large transdiagnostic cohort of children with complex\\nneeds ( N=805) to identify distinct subgroups of children with common proﬁles of behavioural and language\\nstrengths and difﬁculties. We then investigated whether and how these data-driven groupings could be\\ndistinguished from a comparison sample ( N=158) on measures of academic and socioemotional functioning and\\npatterns of global and local white matter connectome organisation. Academic skills were assessed viastandardised measures of reading and maths. Socioemotional functioning was captured by the parent-rated\\nversion of the Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire. Results: We identiﬁed three distinct subgroups of\\nchildren, each with different levels of difﬁculties in structural language, pragmatic communication, and hot andcool executive functions. All three subgroups struggled with academic and socioemotional skills relative to the\\ncomparison sample, potentially representing three alternative but related developmental pathways to difﬁculties\\nin these areas. The children with the weakest language skills had the most widespread difﬁculties with learning,whereas those with more pronounced difﬁculties with hot executive skills experienced the most severe difﬁculties\\nin the socioemotional domain. Each data-driven subgroup could be distinguished from the comparison sample\\nbased on both shared and subgroup-unique patterns of neural white matter organisation. Children with the mostpronounced deﬁcits in language, cool executive, or hot executive function were differentiated from the comparison\\nsample by altered connectivity in predominantly thalamocortical, temporal –parietal-occipital, and frontostriatal\\ncircuits, respectively. Conclusions: These ﬁndings advance our understanding of commonly co-morbid\\nbehavioural and language problems and their relationship to behavioural outcomes and neurobiologicalsubstrates. Keywords: Neurodevelopmental disorders; communication; neural development; language;\\nbehaviour problems.\\nIntroduction\\nDifﬁculties with social communication, executive\\nfunctions (EF), and behaviour are common acrossa range of neurodevelopmental conditions. Prag-matic or social communication impairments areincluded in the diagnos tic criteria for autism\\nspectrum disorders (ASD) and social (pragmatic)communication disorders. Difﬁculties with atten-\\ntion and/or behaviour are characteristic of atten-\\ntion deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), andstructural language problems are the hallmark ofdevelopmental language disorder (DLD) (AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2013 ). While typically\\nassociated with separate disorders, these difﬁcul-ties commonly co-occur across diagnoses. Forexample, children with ADHD often have prag-\\nm a t i cl a n g u a g ed i f ﬁ c u l t i e s( G r e e n ,J o h n s o n ,&Bretherton, 2014 ), and structural communication\\np r o b l e m sa r ec o m m o ni nb o t hc h i l d r e nw i t hADHD (Korrel, Mueller, Silk, Anderson, & Sciber-ras, 2017 ) and ASD (Mandy, Wang, Lee, &\\nSkuse, 2017 ). Similarly, behavioural and atten-\\ntional difﬁculties occur in both ASD and DLD(Henry, Messer, & Nash, 2012 ; Rommelse,\\nGeurts, Franke, Buitelaar, & Hartman, 2011 ).\\nThese comorbidities suggest that problems withsocial communication, EF and behaviour mightnot be independent and disorder-speciﬁc.Instead, they likely share common aetiological\\norigins and/or may interact dynamically, such\\nthat difﬁculties in one area might cascade devel-opmentally to trigger problems in another (Mas-ten et al., 2005 ).\\nComorbidity is one of the main challenges to the\\ncurrent diagnostic system. This is further com-pounded by high levels of symptom variabilitywithin diagnostic categories: very different pro-\\nﬁles of strengths and difﬁculties are common\\namong children with the same diagnostic label\\n†The CALM Team members are presented in\\nAcknowledgements\\nConﬂict of interest statement: No conﬂicts declared.\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

For example, not all children with\\nADHD have EF impairments, and there is sub-stantial heterogeneity among those who do (Koﬂeret al., 2019 ). This has led to widespread recogni-\\ntion of the limitations of diagnostic frameworks\\nfor guiding research and support strategies, andan increase in the applicat ion of transdiagnostic\\napproaches for understan ding neurodevelopment\\n(see Astle, Holmes, Kievit, & Gathercole, 2021 ,f o r\\nar e v i e w ) .\\nTransdiagnostic approaches to neurodevelopment\\nThe dominant method for studying neurodevelop-mental disorders involves comparing groups ofchildren with a neurodevelopmental disorder toanother diagnostic/deﬁcit group, or a typicallydeveloping group, using univariate analyticalapproaches to tease apart differences. Transdiag-nostic approaches adopt alternative recruitment\\nand analytical strategies. In these studies, children\\nwith a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders arerecruited, and/or diagnosis-based enrolment isreplaced with enrolment based on needs. In thelatter case, children who experience difﬁculties inthe studied realm(s) are sampled regardless ofwhether their needs meet diagnostic thresholds(Holmes, Bryant, & Gathercole, 2019 ). Alternatively,\\nlarge demographically representative cohorts,\\nincluding individuals spanning the full spectrumof ability, are studied.\\nIn terms of analyses, one goal is to identify\\ndimensional characteristics that can predict orexplain difﬁculties experienced across individualsirrespective of diagnostic status (e.g. Brislinet al., 2021 ). The relations between different\\ndimensions and their links to neural/genetic fac-\\ntors can then be studied to identify potentialmechanisms of shared or unique variance(Holmes et al., 2020 ; Parkes et al., 2021 ). A com-\\nplementary analytical approach often described asclustering orsubtyping ,\\n1focuses on deriving\\nhomogenous data-driven groupings of children withsimilar proﬁles of relative strengths and weak-\\nnesses along the studied dimensions (Feczko\\net al., 2018 ). These novel groupings can then be\\nsimilarly used to facilitate the discovery of commonaetiological pathways to speciﬁc difﬁculties or tostratify individuals to support strategies appropri-ate for their needs.\\nBoth approaches provide important and comple-\\nmentary insights into the aetiology of transdiagnos-\\ntic symptoms and their implications for functioning.\\nAs one example, consider EFs. Dimensionalapproaches provide support for two dimensions ofEF: cool EFs refer to the ability to regulate behaviourand cognition in emotionally neutral contexts,whereas hot EF skills are implicated in situationsof stronger motivational and emotional valence(Castellanos, Sonuga-Barke, Milham, & Tan-\\nnock, 2006 ). Studies using dimensional analyses\\nreveal these dimensions of EF are related, but areassociated with relatively distinct neural networks(Salehinejad, Ghanavati, Rashid, & Nitsche, 2021 )\\nand have somewhat different predictive validity in\\nterms of cool EF being more closely related toacademic achievement and hot EF more predictiveof disruptive behaviours (e.g. Willoughby, Kuper-smidt, Voegler-Lee, & Bryant, 2011 ).\\nSubgrouping approaches similarly reveal that dif-\\nferent EF proﬁles have relatively distinct neuralcorrelates and are associated with different out-\\ncomes. For example, Vaidya et al. ( 2020 ) identiﬁed\\nthree data-driven EF-subgroups across typicallydeveloping, autistic and ADHD children. These sub-groups explained more variance in frontal –parietal\\nengagement (inferred via functional MRI) during asustained attention task than diagnostic groupings.Similarly, Bathelt, Holmes, et al. ( 2018 ) identiﬁed\\nthree distinct EF-subgroups in a transdiagnostic\\nsample of struggling youth. Each subgroup was\\nassociated with different variations in white matterconnections in prefrontal regions, and there wasmore within-group homogeneity in the behaviouralproﬁles of the derived subgroups than in groupingsbased on the diagnosis. Both examples demonstratethat studying subgroups in transdiagnostic samplescan facilitate the linking of behavioural phenotypes\\nto neurophysiological mechanisms.\\nTransdiagnostic approaches to neurodevelopmental\\ncomorbidities\\nThe examples of transdiagnostic designs described so\\nfar are typical of the ﬁeld, with a focus on onedomain\\nof function (e.g., EF). An important next step is to\\napply these methods to multiple areas of functioning\\nto advance our understanding of the co-occurrence ofdifﬁculties across multiple domains. We attempted to\\ndo this in an earlier study by exploring how symptomsof communication, behaviour, and EF difﬁcultiesrelate to one another in a transdiagnostic cohort ofchildren (Mareva & Holmes, 2019 ). Using a network\\napproach, we were able to investigate how speciﬁc\\nsymptoms cluster together and start to understand\\nhow these clusters of difﬁculties are linked.\\nFour densely interrelated clusters of symptoms\\nwere identiﬁed relating to structural language andlearning, hot EF, pragmatic communication and peerrelationships, and cool EF. The symptoms withineach cluster did not align with the diagnosticfeatures of any diagnosis. Moreover, speciﬁc symp-\\ntoms bridged these clusters (e.g., inappropriate\\ninitiation of communication linked the pragmaticcommunication and hot EF clusters), providing someinsight into the co-occurrence of symptoms acrossdomains of difﬁculty. It may be the case that thesebridging symptoms trigger difﬁculties through devel-opmental cascades (Masten et al., 2005 ) or,\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

It isalso possible that bridging symptoms do not signalinteracting areas of difﬁculties, but instead reﬂectshared neural and/or genetic underpinnings.\\nLinking transdiagnostic proﬁles to aetiological\\nfactors\\nClassifying individuals into heterogeneous and often\\noverlapping diagnostic categories makes it difﬁcultto understand the shared inﬂuence of aetiologicalfactors (Kapur, Phillips, & Insel, 2012 ), but identify-\\ning groups of children with similar behavioural\\nproﬁles, irrespective of diagnostic status, may pro-vide one way to map symptoms on to underlyingneurophysiology (e.g., Bathelt, Holmes, et al., 2018 ;\\nVaidya et al., 2020 ). In the current study, we use this\\napproach to identify groups of children with similarproﬁles across multiple domains of function andexplore group differences in neural white matter\\norganisation. Diffusion tensor imaging enabled us to\\nestimate the macroscopic organisation of the white-matter connectivity of the brain in vivo. By analysingwhat are known as structural connectomes (Basser,Pajevic, Pierpaoli, Duda, & Aldroubi, 2000 ) we were\\nable to explore how brain connectivity varied acrosschildren in the different subgroups. We focused onwhite matter because its maturation is an important\\naspect of post-natal neural development. White\\nmatter architecture enables efﬁcient communicationbetween discrete brain regions and shapes theprocesses underlying brain function (Honey, Thi-vierge, & Sporns, 2010 ). Variation in global white\\nmatter organisation has been linked to differences ingeneral cognitive abilities, reading and mathematicsskills (Bathelt, Gathercole, Butterﬁeld, &\\nAstle, 2018 ; Bathelt, Scerif, Nobre, & Astle, 2019 ;\\nKoenis et al., 2015 ). It has also been implicated in\\nneurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD andASD (Beare et al., 2017 ; Cao et al., 2013 ; Qian\\net al., 2021 ), with both shared and distinct differ-\\nences reported in white matter organisation acrosschildren with different neurodevelopmental disor-ders (Ameis et al., 2016 ; Qian et al., 2021 ). Exam-\\nples of structural neural substrate variation\\nimplicated in multiple neurodevelopmental condi-tions include the corticostriatal circuits, thalamicradiations, and interhemispheric pathways (Ameiset al., 2016 ; Aoki et al., 2017 ; Arnsten &\\nRubia, 2012 ; Tung et al., 2021 ; Zhao, Yang, Gong,\\nCao, & Liu, 2022 ).\\nThe current study\\nThe aim of the current study was to identify\\nhomogenous subgroups of children with similarbehavioural, EF, and communication strengths/dif-ﬁculties in a large transdiagnostic sample. We thenexplored how the proﬁles of these transdiagnosticsubgroups related to measures of white matter\\norganisation, and academic and socioemotional\\nfunctioning. Our previous study included a subsam-ple of the currently studied population, andfocussed on identifying clusters of symptoms that\\ncharacterised the sample (Mareva & Holmes, 2019 ).\\nIndividual differences at the symptom level can driveclusters or subgroups of individuals who share\\nsimilar symptom proﬁles. Therefore, here, we use a\\ncomplementary subgrouping approach to study how\\nthis space is occupied by participants , enabling us to\\nfurther explore the associations between these pro-ﬁles and academic and socioemotional functioningand underlying neurobiology. In other words, wesearched for individuals with similar proﬁles acrossthe four previously identiﬁed clusters of difﬁculties.The measures included in the subgrouping were\\nchosen to capture transdiagnostic features (i.e.,\\nthose that have been previously implicated in severaldisorders). These were measured by parent ratingson scales commonly used across health and educa-tional settings. To explore the external validity of thesubgroups and further characterise their proﬁles, weinvestigated how they differed on external (i.e., notincluded in the subgroup identiﬁcation) measures of\\nnonverbal cognitive ability, and academic and\\nsocioemotional functioning, which are theorised tobe related to interindividual differences in commu-nication and EF (Arnold, Hodgkins, Kahle, Madhoo,& Kewley, 2020 ; Harpin, Mazzone, Raynaud, Kahle,\\n& Hodgkins, 2016 ; Helland & Helland, 2017 ). We\\ndid not formulate a hypothesis about the number ofgroups, their speciﬁc proﬁles, or the neural and\\nexternal behavioural features that would differenti-\\nate them. Instead, we designed the study as anexploratory investigation aiming to address twobroad questions: (a) can we identify robust sub-groups of children presenting with distinct proﬁles ofexecutive, language, and communication strengths/difﬁculties within a large transdiagnostic sample ofstruggling learners; (b) do such data-driven groups\\nshow any differences in academic attainment,\\nsocioemotional functioning, and white matter organ-isation relative to a comparison sample.\\nMethods\\nThe data presented here were collected as part of a cohort\\nstudy at the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory(CALM). Data collection took part between 2014 and 2021.\\nRecruitment\\nFull details about the CALM cohort are available in the studyprotocol (Holmes et al., 2019 ). Brieﬂy, two groups of children\\nwere recruited: (a) a cohort of children aged 5 –18 years who\\nwere referred by health and education practitioners for difﬁ-culties with attention, memory, and/or learning; (b) a com-parison group who were not referred for difﬁculties.

Items are organised into 10 subscales:\\nSpeech, Syntax, Semantics, Coherence, Inappropriate initia-\\ntion, Stereotyped language, Use of context, Nonverbal commu-nication, Social relations, and Interests. Raw scores werecalculated, but age was regressed from each subscale to\\nensure the analyses were not biased by age.\\nSubgroup validation. Strengths and difﬁculties\\nquestionnaire (SDQ): The SDQ (Goodman, 1997 ) mea-\\nsures social and emotional functioning. Items are organised\\ninto ﬁve subscales (only four were analysed in the currentstudy): Emotional Problems, Conduct Problems, Peer Problems,and Prosocial. The ﬁnal SDQ subscale was omitted because it\\ncaptures hyperactivity and overlaps with the Hyperactivity/\\nImpulsivity subscale of the Conners-3 that was included in thecommunity detection. Age-uncorrected SDQ scores were usedin all analyses to allow for easier comparisons with other studies\\nusing this measure. Analyses using age-regressed scores sup-\\nported the same conclusions (Appendix S2).\\nReading and mathematics: To assess children’s aca-\\ndemic abilities the Word Reading and Numerical Operationssubtests of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-II(Wechsler, 2005 ) were administered. Raw scores for each\\nsubtest were converted to age-referenced standard scores to\\nenable performance to be compared to age-expected norms.\\nNonverbal cognitive ability: The Matrix Reasoning\\nsubtest of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence\\n(Wechsler, 2011 ) was administered as an index of non-verbal\\ncognitive ability. The raw score, corresponding to the numberof correctly completed matrices, was converted into an age-referenced T-score, allowing for straightforward interpretation\\nrelative to age-expected levels.\\nMRI data acquisition\\nThe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected on aSiemens 3T Prisma-ﬁt system using a 32-channel quadrature\\nhead coil. T1-weighted volume scans were acquired using awhole-brain coverage 3D Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acqui-sition Gradient Echo (MP RAGE) sequence acquired using\\n1 mm isometric image resolution. Echo time was 2.98 ms, and\\nrepetition time was 2,250 ms. Diffusion scans were obtainedusing echo-planar diffusion-weighted images with an isotropicset of 68 noncollinear directions, using a weighting factor of\\nb=1,000 s 9mm\\n/C02, interleaved with 4 T2-weighted ( b=0)\\nvolume. Whole brain coverage was based on 60 contiguousaxial slices and isometric image resolution of 2 mm. Echo time\\nwas 90 ms and repetition time was 8,500 ms. Both MRI pre-\\nprocessing and reconstruction were performed using QSIPrep0.13.0RC1, which is based on Nipype 1.6.0 (Gorgolewskiet al., 2011 ). All pre-processing steps are reported in the\\nSupporting Information (Appendix S3). Whole-brain white\\nmatter connectivity matrices (i.e. connectomes) were con-structed for each child based on the Brainnetome atlas (Fanet al., 2016 ). For each pairwise combination of regions\\n(N=246), the number of streamlines intersecting them was\\nestimated and transformed to a 246 9246 streamline matrix.\\nStatistical analysis overview\\nA data-driven community detection algorithm was applied to\\nthe child-by-child associations across the behaviour, EF, andcommunication ratings in the referred sample to identifysubgroups of children with similar proﬁles of behavioural\\nand communication strengths and difﬁculties. The demo-\\ngraphic and diagnostic characteristics, academic performance,socioemotional ratings, and neural white matter connectionswere then compared across the derived subgroups and the\\ncomparison sample.

A network was built to represent\\nthechild-by-childcorrelationsacrossthe24subscalesoftheCCC-2, Conners-3, and BRIEF questionnaires for those in the referred\\nsample. Child-by-child correlations were the focus of the commu-\\nnity detection to capture similarities and differences in children’sproﬁles across the subscales. This method has been previouslyused to identify subgroups of children with similar neuropsycho-\\nlogical proﬁles, temperaments, and EF-related behavioural prob-\\nlems (Bathelt, Holmes, et al., 2018 ; Fair, Bathula, Nikolas, &\\nNigg, 2012 ; Karalunas et al., 2014 ). Before estimating the child-\\nby-child correlations, missing data were estimated and age was\\nregressed from each scale to ensure the community detection was\\nnot biased by age (see Appendix S1for details). The community\\ndetection was based on the Louvain weight-conserving algorithm\\n(gamma set at default value of 1), as implemented in the Brain\\nConnectivity Toolbox (BCT: Rubinov & Sporns, 2010 ). The\\nstrength of the community separation was quantiﬁed using theasymmetric modularity (Q) index (Rubinov & Sporns, 2011 ),\\nwhich conceptually represents the overall segregation between\\nidentiﬁed communities, with values above 0.3 considered evi-dence for sufﬁcient community separation (Blondel, Guillaume,Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008 ; Newman & Girvan, 2004 ). This\\nmethod performs well in recovering the true number of commu-\\nnities across a range of conditions and simulations suggest thesample size of the referred cohort was suitable for this analysis(Agelink van Rentergem, Bathelt, & Geurts, 2021 ;G a t e s ,H e n r y ,\\nSteinley, & Fair, 2016 ). To reach a stable community assignment,\\nwe applied the consensus clustering method with 1,000 iterations(Lancichinetti & Fortunato, 2012 ), a procedure that has demon-\\nstrated robustness even at substantial levels of noise in the data\\n(Bathelt, Holmes, et al., 2018 ).\\nSubgroup proﬁles and behavioural validation. A\\nseries of two-tailed t-tests with Holm corrected p-values were\\nrun to compare the proﬁles of the derived subgroups to each\\nother, and to the comparison group, to quantify variation in the\\nseverity of difﬁculties across data-driven groups and to capturedifferences relative to the non-referred children. To facilitatethe interpretation of the subgroup proﬁles, the communication\\nand behavioural data used in the community detection were\\nreduced via Principal Component analyses (PCA) and compo-nent scores were extracted and compared across the groups.\\nData from both the referred and comparison samples were\\ncombined for the PCA, and the optimal number of componentsto retain was chosen based on the results of parallel analyses(see Appendix S2). Separate PCAs were run for the measure of\\ncommunication (CCC-2) and the two measures of behaviour\\ncombined (BRIEF and Conners-3). Additional group compar-isons were conducted on measures not included in thecommunity detection to externally validate and further char-\\nacterise the proﬁles of the subgroups.\\nNeuroimaging analysis. Neural white matter connec-\\ntome data were analysed using graph theory. The nodes of the\\nnetwork were the 246 regions of the Brainnetome atlas (Fan\\net al., 2016 ) and the connections (or edges) corresponded to the\\nnumber of streamlines intersecting each pair of regions. Allconnectome analyses are based on weighted unthresholded\\nmatrices. This choice was motivated by observing that the\\napplication of consistency-thresholding (Roberts, Perry, Roberts,Mitchell, & Breakspear, 2017 ) to retain the top 30% or 20% of\\nmost consistent edges (on the assumption that the connections\\nwith the highest inter-subject variability are spurious) fully\\nreproduced the results based on unthresholded matrices. Weexplored whether and how each derived subgroup differed from\\nthe comparison sample and did not compare the data-driven\\nsubgroups to one another. This approach was chosen to reducethe number of comparisons and to investigate both common andsubgroup-uniquedifferencesamongthereferredchildrenrelative\\nto the non-referred children. Due to the presence of outliers in thedata, the global and local metrics of the data-driven subgroups\\nwere compared to the comparison group using 10% trimmed-\\nmeans pairwise t-tests with false-discovery rate correction.\\nGlobal and local metrics: At the whole-brain level, we\\nfocussed on global efﬁciency and global clustering coefﬁcients.\\nThese metrics were chosen because they have been previously\\nlinked to children’s educational attainment and general cognitiveabilities (Bathelt, Gathercole, et al., 2018 ,B a t h e l te ta l . , 2019 ;\\nKoenis et al., 2015 ) and have been implicated in neurodevelop-\\nmental disorders such as ADHD (Cao et al., 2013 ). Global\\nefﬁciency describes the potential for information exchange inthenetworkandistheaverageinversedistancefromanynode(i.e.brain region) to any other node (Sporns, Honey, & K €otter, 2007 ).\\nGlobal clustering quantiﬁes the fraction of each node’s neigh-\\nboursthatarealsoneighboursofeachother.Theglobalclusteringmetric was normalised according to the average of 1,000 randomgraphs using the algorithms for weighted undirected networks\\nimplemented in the GRETNA toolbox (Wang et al., 2015 ). Subse-\\nquently, to explore the local properties of the connectomes withthe minimal number of comparisons, the 246 brain regions in the\\nBrainnetome atlas (Fan et al., 2016 ) were grouped according to\\ntheir corresponding intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN) asdeﬁned by Yeo et al. ( 2011 ): Default mode, Dorsal attention,\\nFrontoparietal, Limbic, Somatomotor, and Visual networks.\\nSubcortical regions were also grouped together. The sum of all\\nconnections within each network (and the subcortex) of theconnectomewascalculated.Thisapproachisbasedontheknownstructuralandfunctionalorganisationpropertiesofthe brainand\\nwas therefore favoured as a balanced alternative to hypothesis-\\ndriven pre-speciﬁed regions of interest approach or a fully data-driven reduction of the connectomes. For each data-driven\\nsubgroup, networks that showed a signiﬁcant difference from\\nthe comparison group were selected for further analyses. Subse-quently,thenodestrength(i.e.,thesumofallconnections)ineachregion within the networks ﬂagged as signiﬁcantly different was\\ntested against the comparison group. The functional character-\\nisation of these regions was based on the behavioural domainmetadata labels of the BrainMap Database ( www.brainmap.org/\\ntaxonomy ), which uses both forward and reverse inferences\\n(Eickhoff & Grefkes, 2011 ; Fox, Lancaster, Laird, & Eick-\\nhoff, 2014 ). Prior to the analyses, age, sex, and average frame\\ndisplacement were regressed from each graph metric using a\\nrobustregressionapproachtoaccountforoutliers.Controllingfor\\nthese covariates is recommended and is standard practice inneurodevelopmental neuroimaging research (Alexander-Blochet al., 2016 ;J o n e se ta l . , 2021 ;L u n ae ta l . , 2021 ).\\nNetwork-based statistics (NBS): To investigate differ-\\nences in the connections between regions we used NBS, which in\\nmany cases offers greater statistical power compared to tradi-tional correction methods (Zalesky, Fornito, & Bullmore, 2010 ).\\nThis is a whole-brain data-driven method and is described in\\ndetail in Appendix S3. Brieﬂy, each data-driven subgroup was\\ncompared to the non-referred group to identify subnetworksthat differentiate the groups. The following parameters were\\nused: t-threshold 2.8, intensity measure of size, and family-wise\\nerror (FWE) p<.01. Age, sex, and average frame displacement\\nwere used as covariates in all analyses. To ensure the robust-ness of the results, we repeated all procedures by varying the\\ntarget t-threshold, exploring the extent-based measure of size,\\nand setting a more liberal FWE-correction ( p<.05).\\nRESULTS\\nCommunity detection\\nCommunity detection applied to the child-by-child\\ncorrelation network based on the Louvain algorithm\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

The value of the Q-metric was above 0.3,\\nsuggesting a good level of community separation(Blondel et al., 2008 ).\\nSubgroup proﬁles\\nThe proﬁles of the subgroups identiﬁed by the\\ncommunity detection and the comparison groupacross the 24 subscales are displayed in Figure 1A.\\nDescriptive statistics and Cohen’s deffect size are\\npresented in Table S1. To aid the interpretation of\\nthe differences across the groups, data were reduced\\nwith two PCAs, one applied to the CCC-2 and a\\nsecond to the combined BRIEF and Conners-3 data(see Figures S2and S3for correlations). This deci-\\nsion allowed us to consider communication andbehaviour separately. The CCC-2 data reductionidentiﬁed two components capturing structural andpragmatic communication, which in combinationexplained 80% of the variance. Two components\\nbroadly corresponding to hot EF and cool EF sum-\\nmarised the Conners-3 and BRIEF data, cumula-tively explaining 68% of the variance (Figure 1B,C ;\\nfull report in the Appendix S2and Figures S4and\\nS5). As a sensitivity analysis, in Appendix S2we also\\nreport the results of parallel analysis and PCAapplied to the CCC-2, Conners-3, and BRIEF datatogether. This approach supported broadly similar\\nconclusions, with the exception that hot EF and\\npragmatic skills loaded on a single component. Thefull details are available in the Supporting Informa-tion (Figures S6andS7).\\nGroup proﬁles across the four components are\\ndisplayed in Figure 1D. The data-driven subgroups\\nhad signiﬁcantly more difﬁculties across all compo-nents relative to the comparison sample, except for\\nSubgroup 2 (S2) who had similar hot EF to the\\ncomparison sample. The children in each subgrouphad different patterns of speciﬁc strengths anddifﬁculties. Subgroup 1 (S1) were characterised bypoor structural language, children in S2 had weak-nesses in cool EF, and children in Subgroup 3 (S3)had pronounced difﬁculties with hot EF and prag-matics (Table S2). The same patterns were evident in\\nthe subgroup proﬁles on the subscales that most\\nstrongly loaded on the respective principal compo-nents (Table S1and Figure 1A). One-way ANOVA\\nsuggested no signiﬁcant differences in age across thesubgroups ( F(1,803) =3.138, p=.08, Table 1), but\\npairwise t-tests with Holm correction for multiple\\ncomparisons suggested that children in S2 weresigniﬁcantly older than children in S3 ( t=2.56,\\np\\ncorrected =.03), with an average difference of\\n6.34 months. Using a chi-square test, which com-pared the overall proportion of boys and girls in thenon-referred sample to the proportion observed ineach subgroup, we observed that girls were overrep-resented in S1, while boys were overrepresented in S3(Table 1). The same chi-square analyses were used toinvestigate whether there were differences in the\\nprevalence of different diagnoses across subgroups.We focused on children with ADHD and ASDbecause overall numbers for other diagnoses weretoo low to make meaningful comparisons. Children\\nwith ADHD and ASD were represented in each\\nsubgroup, but children with ADHD were overrepre-sented in S3 and underrepresented in S1, andchildren with ASD were underrepresented in S2 andoverrepresented in S3 (Table 1). Analyses compar-\\ning the prevalence of ADHD subtypes across clus-ters were not pursued due to most children withADHD having a diagnosis of Combined type ADHD.\\nOnly one child had a diagnosis of predominantly\\nHyperactive/ Impulsive ADHD (included in S3) andonly 14 a diagnosis of the predominantly Inattentivetype (two cases included in S1, seven in S2, and ﬁvein S3). Finally, children who had recently receivedSpeech and Language Therapy were overrepre-sented in S1 and underrepresented in the othertwo subgroups (Table 1).\\nSubgroup proﬁles: Behavioural validation\\nThe groups were compared on external measures not\\nused in the community detection (Figure 2). In terms\\nof socioemotional functioning and cognitive andacademic performance, all three subgroups derivedfrom the referred sample had signiﬁcantly more\\ndifﬁculties than the comparison sample (Figure 2).\\nThere were differences in the patterns of severityamong the subgroups. Children in S1 had the mostpronounced difﬁculties with maths, reading, andnon-verbal reasoning, scoring signiﬁcantly lowerthan the other two data-driven groups. Children inS3 had better performance than the other twosubgroups in math and reading, but signiﬁcantly\\nmore difﬁculties with emotion, conduct, peer rela-\\ntions, and prosocial behaviour (Figure 2).\\nOverall, three subgroups were identiﬁed captur-\\ning children with principal difﬁculties with struc-tural communication (S1), cool EFs (S2), and hotEFs and pragmatics (S3). Considering measures,which were not included in the community detec-tion, there was a consistent pattern in which\\nchildren in S3 had more pronounced socioemo-\\ntional difﬁculties, whereas children in S1 and S2showed more difﬁculties with cognitive and aca-demic skills.\\nSubgroup proﬁles: Neural white matter\\nGraph measures.

Subnetworks that were signiﬁcantly different\\nfor each subgroup relative to the comparison groupare displayed in Figure 4. There was greater connec-\\ntivity in the non-referred group relative to S1 in asubnetwork comprising ﬁve connections across lim-\\nbic—subcortical and subcortical –subcortical areas\\n(p\\ncorrected =.001). This subnetwork involved six\\nregions located within the BG, orbital gyrus, andthalamus (Table S5). For S2, there was reduced\\nconnectivity relative to the comparison group in asubnetwork spanning nine connections across 10regions ( p\\ncorrected =.003). This subnetwork included\\nconnections across the following networks: somato-\\nmotor—dorsal attention, limbic —dorsal attention,\\ndorsal attention —visual, frontoparietal —somato-\\nmotor, visual —visual, and dorsal attention —\\nsubcortical. The involved regions fell within thelateral occipital cortex (LOC), medioventral occipitalcortex, orbital gyrus, PHG, precuneus, superiorparietal lobule, STG, and thalamus (Table S6).\\nFinally, S3 had reduced connection strength relative\\nto the comparison group in a subnetwork comprised\\nof eight links ( p\\ncorrected =.002) across limbic —\\nsubcortical, limbic —visual, visual —subcortical,\\nand subcortical —subcortical regions. The eight\\nregions involved formed part of the BG, LOC, middlefrontal gyrus, orbital gyrus, precuneus (this regionwas also part of the network that differentiated S2),and thalamus (Table S7). Results based on the more\\nliberal FWE-corrected threshold of p<.05 suggested\\nfurther differences for S3 (Figure S10). Sensitivity\\nanalyses supported the robustness of the ﬁndings:taking the extent-based measure of size fully repro-duced the results; and setting the t-threshold in the\\nrange of 2.6 to 3, produced similar results, whichfollowed the expected tendency to discover largersubnetworks at lower t-thresholds (Figure S11; for\\nan investigation of the inﬂuence of the t-threshold,\\nsee Beare et al., 2017 ).\\nOverall, the three subgroups showed a mix of\\nsimilar and subgroup-unique patterns of differenti-ation from the comparison sample. At the globallevel, the two groups (S1 and S2) with the mostpronounced difﬁculties with academic achievementshowed reduced global efﬁciency compared to the\\nnon-referred group. At the ICN-level, all subgroups\\nshowed reduced connection strengths in the limbicnetwork and the subcortex relative to the compar-ison sample. There were both common andsubgroup-speciﬁc differences in the connectionstrength of regions within the limbic network andthe subcortex. Finally, at a whole-connectome level,we identiﬁed subnetworks that differentiated each\\nsubgroup from the comparison sample.\\nDiscussion\\nThe current study adopted a data-driven approach toidentify subgroups of children with homogeneousproﬁles across different domains of function asmeasured by ratings of communication, behaviour,and EF. A transdiagnostic approach was used:enrolment was based on cognitive and academicneeds rather than diagnostic status. Differences inbrain structure and behaviour were compared\\nacross the subgroups in relation to a comparison\\ngroup. Three subgroups of children were identiﬁed.Each performed more poorly than the comparisongroup across measures of communication, beha-viour, and EF, and was distinguished from the othersubgroups by different proﬁles of strengths andweaknesses in these areas. These differencesextended to measures of cognitive, academic, and\\nsocioemotional functioning that were not included in\\nthe identiﬁcation of the subgroups. Shared andspeciﬁc patterns of differences in neural white mat-ter organisation were observed across the groups.These results are discussed below.\\nSubgroups\\nThree data-driven subgroups were identiﬁedbased on parent/carer ratings of behaviour, com-munication, and EF in a large transdiagnostic sam-ple of children referred by practitioners fordifﬁculties in attention, learning, and/or memory.One subgroup (S1) was characterised by relativedifﬁculties in structural language use, a second bycool cognitive difﬁculties (S2), and a third by co-\\noccurring pragmatic communication difﬁculties and\\nhotaffective cognitive problems (S3). All three sub-\\ngroups had greater difﬁculties in behaviour, com-munication, EF, socioemotional functioning, andacademic attainment relative to a demographicallymatched comparison group of non-referred children.\\nThere were both similarities and differences in the\\nway neural white matter was organised in the three\\nsubgroups relative to the comparison group.

These difﬁculties encompassed everyday dif-ﬁculties in attention, planning, and working memory -skills that have been implicated in classroom learning(Peng, Wang, & Namkung, 2018 ). Consistent with\\nthis, children in this subgroup had difﬁculties inmaths and reading, although these were not as severe\\nas those for children in S1. Relative to the other two\\nsubgroups, children in S2 had relative strengths insocial skills and affective cognition, with comparablehot EF ratings to the comparison group.\\nSubregions that uniquely deviated in S2 included\\nregions within the caudate, PHG, ITG, STG, andlateral amygdala. The subnetwork that differentiatedthem from the comparison group was relatively\\nwidespread and involved right-lateralised temporal –\\nparietal pathways and medioventral and lateraloccipital regions. Some of the implicated subregionsof these dorsal attention and visual networks areknown to interact to suppress attention to irrelevantstimuli (Castellanos & Proal, 2012 ; Shulman\\net al., 2009 ), and as such reduced connectivity in\\nthis neural circuit might contribute to the cool EF-\\nrelated difﬁculties characteristic of this subgroup. In\\nparticular, seven of the nine connections within theidentiﬁed subnetwork involved right caudal area 7,which is implicated in cool EFs such as attention,working memory, inhibition, and spatial cognition(for details, see http://atlas.brainnetome.org/ , Fan\\net al., 2016 ).\\nS3\\nThe children in S3 were characterised by having the\\nmost severe difﬁculties with hot EF and pragmaticcommunication, but relative strengths in structurallanguage skills, maths and reading, compared to thechildren in the other two subgroups. Strong associ-ations between social communication skills and\\naffective behavioural problems have been reported\\npreviously (e.g., Hawkins, Gathercole, Astle, &Holmes, 2016 ; Mareva & Holmes, 2019 ), and difﬁ-\\nculties in these areas commonly co-occur in ADHDand ASD (Green et al., 2014 ) alongside socioemo-\\ntional difﬁculties (Staikova, Gomes, Tartter, McCabe,& Halperin, 2013 ). Indeed, a disproportionate num-\\nber of autistic children and children with an ADHD\\ndiagnosis were assigned to this subgroup, and they\\nhad substantial problems with behavioural conduct,emotion, peer relationships, and prosocial beha-viour. Identifying a subgroup with this proﬁle andcomposition suggests the intersection of pragmaticcommunication, hot EF, and socioemotional difﬁcul-ties may be relevant for understanding some of thecomorbidity between ADHD and ASD.The neural characteristics that speciﬁcally differ-\\nentiated children in S3 from the comparison groupwere regions within the putamen, thamalus, andcingulate gyrus. They had reduced connectivitystrength in a left-lateralised, primarily frontostriatal\\nsubnetwork, which also included regions of the\\nvisual network (precuneus and LOC). Consistentwith the severity of their hot EF difﬁculties, thesecircuits play a role in goal-directed behavioursrelated to reward, affect, and motivation (Arnsten &Rubia, 2012 ).\\nSummary of proﬁles\\nIn summary, we identiﬁed three subgroups of\\nchildren with distinct communication, behavioural,and EF proﬁles. These subgroups were charac-terised by primary difﬁculties in structural lan-guage, cool EF, or hot EF and pragmatics,respectively, and provide initial evidence for threealternative but related pathways to academic and\\nsocioemotional difﬁculties. While a greater number\\nof children receiving speech and language therapywere assigned to the structural language subgroup,and more autistic children and those with ADHD tothe hot EF and pragmatics subgroup, none of thesubgroup proﬁles aligned with the diagnostic fea-tures of a particular disorder, and children witheach of these diagnoses were present in each of the\\nthree subgroups. This ﬁnding suggests the sub-\\ngroups were not synonymous with disorder-basedcategories, adding to growing support for transdi-agnostic approaches to understanding neurodevel-opment (Astle et al., 2021 ).\\nThe three subgroups were further distinguished by\\npatterns of differences in the connectivity of circuitspreviously implicated in language, executive and\\nvisual attention, and reward processing. These differ-\\nences partially correspond to previously reportedneurobiological correlates of the behavioural difﬁcul-ties of the subgroups, suggesting they may be distin-guished at the neural level. That said, not all regionsthat uniquely differentiated the subgroups from thenon-referred sample had clear links to their beha-vioural proﬁles. It should also be noted that all\\nsubgroups had reduced connection strength within\\nthe limbic network and the subcortex, relative to thecomparison group, and shared several atypicalitieswithin the same subcortical and temporal subregions.Furthermore, their proﬁles of behavioural weak-nesses were all relative, meaning the correspondencebetween brain and behaviour was not one-to-one.\\nTheoretical and practical implications\\nFollowing decades of research shaped by diagnosticcategories, the ﬁeld of neurodevelopmental difﬁcul-ties is currently undergoing a transition in whichexploratory research into how children and their\\n/C2112022 The Authors.

Such research is key for testing, and\\nwhere necessary accordingly modifying, predomi-nant assumptions about diagnostic boundaries orcommon factors that explain the associations\\nbetween symptoms (Astle & Fletcher-\\nWatson, 2020 ). While the current study was not\\ndesigned to explicitly test or falsify a given theory,the ﬁnding that children with different diagnoseswere represented in all data-driven clusters chal-lenges “core deﬁcit” theories that assume that asingle mechanistic impairment can explain the pro-ﬁle of a particular diagnostic group. Instead, our\\nresults are more consistent with accounts empha-\\nsising the possibility that multiple causal pathwayscan lead to the same behavioural phenotype (Cic-chetti & Rogosch, 1996 ). Relatedly, we found little\\nevidence for neat or direct mappings between iso-lated neural structures and behavioural phenotypes.Most brain atypicalities associated with a givenbehavioural phenotype were also observed across\\nthe other phenotypes, casting doubt on claims that\\nfocal neural deﬁcits underlie a given neurodevelop-mental disorder. Our ﬁndings are instead consistentwith the predictions of neuro-constructivist theoriesthat assume developmental difﬁculties have wide-spread effects that result from a brain that hasdeveloped differently over a number of years (John-son, 2011 ; Karmiloff-Smith, 2009 ).\\nThe categorisation of neurodevelopmental difﬁcul-\\nties into discrete disorders has practical merits inproviding health and education practitioners with apragmatic system for selecting and allocating sup-port. It also provides many young people with asense of identity. Receiving a diagnosis can prove apivotal moment in someone’s life, enabling them toidentify with their community. Yet our data, and that\\nof others, highlight that current diagnostic\\napproaches do not capture what it is like to haveadditional needs: the clusters of behavioural symp-toms that children experience do not map on thediagnostic criteria currently used to identify andsupport children’s needs. As such, a more ﬂexible,child-centred approach is needed in which interven-tion decisions are based on individual needs and not\\nprimary diagnoses (Finlay-Jones et al., 2019 ).\\nAttempts to integrate the neurodevelopmental trans-diagnostic framework into clinical settings are justemerging, and in due course we will start to gaininsights into their efﬁcacy and feasibility (Boultonet al., 2021 ). For now, we advocate transdiagnostic\\napproaches, which align with the neurodiversityparadigm (Fletcher-Watson, 2022 ), as a means of\\npromoting more inclusive research and practice.\\nLimitations and future directions\\nThere were several caveats to the current subgroup-\\ning approach. First, the community detection wasbased on parent ratings, which are prone tosubjective bias. However, the differences between\\nthe subgroups identiﬁed through these ratings werereﬂected in differences in performance-based mea-sures of cognition and learning, providing somevalidity to the ratings and suggesting the algorithm\\nwas not overﬁtting the data. Second, the wide age\\nrange and cross-sectional nature of the cohort didnot allow us to explore questions about age-relatedheterogeneity or developmental continuity. Nonethe-less, we did observe a signiﬁcant age differencebetween S2 and S3, suggesting the S3 phenotypewhich was associated with greater social and emo-tional problems may be more prevalent in younger\\nchildren. Finally, despite the sample being substan-\\ntially larger than that typically used in the develop-mental neuroimaging literature, sample sizeconsiderations did not allow us to directly comparethe neural proﬁles of the identiﬁed subgroups to oneanother. Equally important differences in whitematter organisation across subgroups might exist,but larger datasets would be needed to identify\\nthem.\\nConclusions\\nThis study demonstrates the value of data-driven\\nsubgrouping approaches for understanding com-mon, complex and co-occurring neurodevelopmentaldifﬁculties across multiple domains and their rela-\\ntionships to behavioural outcomes and neurobiol-\\nogy. It shows that homogeneous groups can beidentiﬁed and differentiated in terms of distinctproﬁles of relative strengths and difﬁculties acrosscommunication, executive function, and behaviour.The identiﬁed subgroups provide initial evidence forthree alternative but related developmental path-ways to difﬁculties with academic and socioemo-\\ntional functioning.\\nSupporting information\\nAdditional supporting information may be found online\\nin the Supporting Information section at the end of the\\narticle:\\nAppendix S1.
