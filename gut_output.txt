Gut bacterial nutrient preferences quantified in vivo	Xianfeng Zeng, Xi Xing, Meera Gupta, Felix C. Keber, Jaime G. Lopez, Ying-Chiang J. Lee, Asael Roichman, Lin Wang, Michael D. Neinast, Mohamed S. Donia, Martin Wu¨hr, Cholsoon Jang, Joshua D. Rabinowitz	2022	This study utilizes isotope tracing to quantitatively examine the nutrient preferences of gut microbiota in mice. The results indicate that dietary fiber and protein are major inputs for carbohydrate fermentation and branched-chain fatty acid production, respectively. Circulating host metabolites such as lactate and urea also contribute to the gut microbiome. The nutrient preferences of various bacterial genera are assessed, revealing that dietary composition influences microbiome dynamics and metabolite production.

Minimizing treatment-induced emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections	Mathew Stracy, Roy Kishony	2022	This paper discusses the development of predictive models for the risk of gaining antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) and wound infections, using a large dataset collected over several years. It investigates factors like patient demographics, prior antibiotic resistance history, and treatment regimens to identify predictors for treatment outcomes, particularly focusing on early recurrence with gained resistance. The findings aim to guide personalized antibiotic therapy to minimize the emergence of resistance during treatment.

The gut–airway microbiome axis in health and respiratory diseases	Mustafa Özçam, Susan V. Lynch	2024	This review article explores the bidirectional communication between the gut and airway microbiomes and their implications for respiratory health. It summarizes recent findings on the gut–airway axis, the influence of gut microbiota on airway immunity, and identifies various environmental and dietary factors that shape these microbiomes. The expertise of gut microbiota-derived metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and their role in modulating respiratory immunity are discussed, along with the potential for microbiome-based therapies and interventions for respiratory diseases.

Establishment and characterization of stable, diverse, fecal-derived in vitro microbial communities that model the intestinal microbiota	Andrés Aranda-Díaz, Katharine Michelle Ng, Tani Thomsen, Imperio Real-Ramírez, Dylan Dahan, Susannah Dittmar, Carlos Gutierrez Gonzalez, Taylor Chavez, Kimberly S. Vasquez, Taylor H. Nguyen, Feiqiao Brian Yu, Steven K. Higginbottom, Norma F. Neff, Joshua E. Elias, Justin L. Sonnenburg, Kerwyn Casey Huang	2022	The paper discusses a method for the establishment of stool-derived in vitro communities (SICs) that reflect the taxonomic diversity of human gut microbiota. These SICs are shown to be stable and reproducible, maintaining the initial composition from feces, and are capable of modeling responses to antibiotics and pathogen challenges. They can predict compositional changes observed in vivo, such as increased susceptibility to Salmonella after antibiotic treatment. This approach allows researchers to study the gut microbiota under controlled conditions, enhancing understanding of its role in health and disease.
